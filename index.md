## Semantics-Guided Synthesis

*Semantics-guided synthesis* (SemGuS) is a framework for specifying arbitrary synthesis problems. SemGuS allows a user to provide both the syntax and the semantics for the constructs in the language. SemGuS accepts a recursively defined big-step semantics, which allows it, for example, to be used to specify and solve synthesis problems over an imperative programming language that may contain loops with unbounded behavior. The customizable nature of SemGuS also allows synthesis problems to be defined over a non-standard semantics, such as an abstract semantics.

### Specification Language

This webpage will be updated over time to include the formal SemGuS format as well as links to benchmarks and solvers for SemGuS problems.

In the meantime, you can read the [paper](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~loris/papers/popl21.pdf) or watch the [talks](https://app.clowdr.org/conference/popl2021/item/5b50bd98-0c54-4733-866d-5a81a26a23e9) about SemGuS.
