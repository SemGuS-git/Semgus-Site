
## SemGuS Solvers and Benchmarks

Two solvers for SemGuS problems are initially available: Messy and WES (provisional).

### Messy

Messy is a constraint-based Semgus solver that reduces synthesis into solving a set of CHCs, as described in the [Semantics-Guided Synthesis paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3434311). One key feature of Messy is that it can also prove unrealizability: that is, identify when synthesis problems do not have a solution.
